
This is an MATLAB implementation of the Argument Cut Relaxation based Branch-and-Bound (ACR-BB) algorithm proposed in the paper

Cheng Lu and Ya-Feng Liu, "An Efficient Global Algorithm for Single-Group Multicast Beamforming," to appear in IEEE Transsactions on Signal Processing.

You can run the code Main.m to check out the results on applying the ACR-BB algorithm for solving the single-group multicast beamforming problem where 
the number of the antennas at the base station is 4 and the number of users is 8.

If you have any questions or comments on using the codes, please feel free to contact Dr. Cheng Lu at lucheng1983@163.com.

If you find that the codes are helpful in solving your problems, please mention the above paper in your paper/report.Thanks very much!
